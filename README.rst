BASICODE was developed in 1980 by Dutch broadcaster *NOS* for its hobby-electronics radio programme Hobbyscoop.
Its purpose was to enable radio-transmission of software that could be used on the various different 8-bit
micro-computers that were popular at the time.

The BASICODE project consisted of the following elements:

- A subset of classic Microsoft BASIC common to the BASIC dialects of the target platforms
- A standard set of subroutines to provide functionality for which no common BASIC syntax existed
- An audio modulation format intended to be readable by data cassette players
- A native program for the target platform, which would decode the common audio format and supplement the
  resulting BASICODE program with the platform's implementation of the standard subroutines.

BASICODE users would tape record the modulated program from the radio and use their copy of the translation program
and their computer's cassette player to read the tape. If everything went well, they would then be able to run and
use the program transmitted.

*NOS* started BASICODE transmissions in 1982 on medium wave Dutch radio. Other broadcasters followed suit:
Dutch broadcasters *NOS* and *TROS*, the British *BBC*, the West German *WDR* and
the East German *Rundfunk der DDR* all at one time or another performed regular BASICODE transmissions.

While the authors and broadcasters retained copyrights on the programs, they encouraged them to be shared widely
for non-commercial purposes.
