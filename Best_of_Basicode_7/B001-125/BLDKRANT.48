AMATEUR VAN HET JAAR

Met enige trots kunnen we melden dat Nico
Janssen (PA0DLO) gisteren op de Dag van de
Zelfbouw van de Vereniging voor Experimenteel
Radio Onderzoek (VERON) in Nederland is benoemd
tot 'Amateur van het Jaar'. Deze bescheiden
zendamateur verzorgt het zo belangrijke satelliet
nieuws in Nederland. Het is voor vele van zijn
collega's, en voor vele luisteramateurs trouwens
ook, belangrijke een zo constante bron te hebben
van nieuws over Russische, Amerikaanse, Japanse
en Europese ruimtevaart en kunstmanen. Het
accent ligt daarbij op de satellieten die te
gebruiken zijn voor de luister- en zendamateurs.
Het nieuws van Nico is accuraat en actueel.
Maar tot voor kort verscheen het met grote
vertraging in de diverse bladen. Het snelst
was nog het Veron DX-press. In de Hobbyscoop
Beeldkrant verschijnt het bulletin sinds enige
tijd regelmatig, met slechts een vertraging
van enkele dagen, wat voor de waarnemers en
gebruikers van de gegevens van groot belang is.
Bovendien kunnen bladen de kopij van PA0DLO
zonder noemenswaardige vertraging via
Hobbyscoop of via de Fido databank sneller
publiceren. Uiteraard hopen we dat
deze service zo kan worden voortgezet en
feliciteren wij Nico Janssen van ganser harte.

TEST VAN SUPER-ONTVANGER

Onze collega Jonathan Marks van Radio Nederland
Wereldomroep heeft wel al een NRD-525 ontvanger
van Japan Radio Corporation in handen gehad.
Hij heeft niet aan de ontvanger gemeten, maar
zijn ervaringen tellen als die van een zeer
geroutineerde vakman. Van ons krijgt
u later, in een interview, de meetresultaten
nog, maar inmiddels willen we u niet de
ervaringen van 'Mister Media Network' zelf
onthouden. Overigens luistert u wel eens naar
deze Hobbyscoop achtige rubriek op de korte
golf? De uitzendtijden zijn elke donderdag:
 12:30 - 13:25 op 5955, 9715 MHz
 15:30 - 16:25 op 5955, 13770, 15560
 19:30 - 20:25 op 6020 MHz

Het ervaringen van Jonathan zijn uiteraard
in het Engels gesteld.

INTRODUCTION

The more costly a shortwave receiver,
the more difficult it is to review. But
we've had a lot of requests for our
opinion on a recent addition to the
more expensive end of the radio market,
despite the price tag. These days, you
can buy a tremendous amount of
technology for a few hundred dollars,
so when a new set is launched costing
nearer 1200 dollars in North America,
and 3950 guilders in Europe, you may
wonder what the extra money buys you in
terms of better performance. We've just
completed a rather extensive test of a
new receiver from the Japan Radio
Company, its called the NRD 525. It's
the successor to the NRD 515 which has
gained an excellent performance
reputation amongst those discerning
listeners with some budget to spare.

Japan Radio Company generates most of
its revenue from satellite receiver
systems, and marine communications
equipment, all costing much more than
the consumer could ever afford. The NRD
525 is the result of borrowing
technology from higher priced receivers
JRC makes, and finding ways to reduce
the individual unit cost. The 525 is
cheaper than the 515, it's more
compact, and its performance in most
respects is better than its
predecessor. Its size is 330 by 130 by
280 millimetres and it weighs 8.5 kg.
With no carrying handle on it, JRC
clearly intend the receiver to be used
primarily in one spot. The styling in
dark grey and black is in keeping with
modern hi-fi equipment, and clearly a
lot of effort has been made to0make it
easy to operate. Let's take a tour of
the front panel.

FRONT PANEL

There's a large calculator-style keypad
on the right side of the panel, the
keys are well spaced out so that you
can't accidently press two keys at
once. Each time you press a button the
set B E E P s, and you can set the
level of that confirmation beep or
switch it off altogether if you find it
annoying. If you want to listen to
15560 kHz you can either punch in 1 5 5
6 0 kHz or 1 5 . 5 6 0 MHz, the set
recognises both, and you can store up
to 200 favourite frequencies, together
with the bandwidth and mode setting in
the sets built-in memory. You can use a
pushbutton combination to move up or
down the band in 1 kHz steps, or more
likely you'll opt to use the large
manual tuning knob which moves smoothly
in either direction. However, this
receiver sits horizontally on a desk,
which is a bit of a nuisance. Ideally,
the front two rubber feet supporting
the set should be slightly higher, so
that the tuning panel faces up at a
angle, and you can turn the tuning knob
without knocking your fingers on the
table. Resolution on the large green
digital display is to the nearest 100
Hz in the normal mode, though you can
use what's called Receiver Incremental
Tuning (RIT), and check a station's
frequency down to the nearest 1
Hz....that's precision for you.

SELECTIVITY SELECTIONS

The receiver can incorporate up to 4
different bandwidth filters, selected
by a rocker switch. Three are fitted as
standard. You can use the 12 kHz 'very
wide' filter for listening to local
medium and longwave stations with
excellent fidelity. On shortwave, the
wide filter of 4 kHz is better. The
fidelity isn't so good, but
interference from stations on adjacent
channels is eliminated. And when you're
searching for weak signals amongst
strong interference, the 2 and 1 kHz
bandwidth settings are excellent for
selecting the signal you want, and
eliminating the noise that you don't.
The filters are clearly superior to
those fitted on cheaper communications
receivers, such as the Yaesu FRG-8800
or even the ICOM ICR-71. Shape factors
range between 1:1.5 to 1:2.2, which is
well above average. But you're paying
more of course!

The set is capable of picking up
standard broadcast signals, upper and
lower sideband, facsimile, morse and
radio teletype signals between 0.9 and
34 MHz. You can also install an
optional converter which allows you to
pick up very high frequencies between
114-174 MHz, and 423 to 456 MHz for
VHF/UHF DXing. Performance on long,
medium and shortwave is excellent. Lab
measurements show that new NRD 525 is
very slightly less sensitive than the
old NRD 515 on the 60 metre tropical
band. But using the two receivers side
by side with a long wire antenna,
anything heard on one set, could also
be monitored on the other. The ability
of the set to accept weak signals when
there is a strong station on a nearby
frequency, in other words its dynamic
range, is excellent. Using the wide
filter of 4 kHz, the dynamic range was
better than 76 decibels on our example,
and this is one of the few receivers
we've tested that can cope adequately
with the evening power house battles on
the 49 metre band in Europe without
overloading. An antennuator switch is
offered on the set if signals get too
strong, though we didn't need it.

SCANNING/SEARCHING FUNCTIONS

Tuning of the receiver is further
enhanced by a scanning function that
starts to move through anything up to
200 frequencies in the memory. You can
select how fast it scans, and at what
signal strength the scanning should
stop. You can also continously sweep at
a chosen speed through a selected
portion of the radio spectrum. Signal
strength is shown on an electronic
display, which reacts faster than an
ordinary mechanical meter. Three other
controls also deserve a mention. The
first is called pass-band shifting,
which varies the apparent intermediate
frequency of the receiver without
changing the received frequency. That's
useful, and effective if you're getting
splash from a signal on a nearby
frequency. The noise blanker
works to at least reduce the effects of
the Russian over-the-horizon radar
system, the woodpecker, so that the
pulses are reduced to ticks instead.
But no noise blanker can really cope if
someone starts up a welding machine or
a sparking electric drill a few metres
away from the antenna. The notch filter
has a very deep variable notch, useful
for getting rid of 'whistles' on this
signal you want to hear.

BACK PANEL OPTIONS

The back panel of the NRD 525 is almost
as interesting as the front. You can
install a connection to a home computer
via an RS-232 interface. But the
English instructions with this only
tell you the specifications of how the
receivers micro-processor can be
controlled. It assumes you are
sufficiently conversant with computer
programming to write your own software!
That is not usually the case. Several
software companies are currently
working on solutions for the NRD 525 in
the USA. You can connect the set to a
12 Volt car battery, or directly to a
household current supply at either 110
or 220 volts. Facilities exist to
control an external tape recorder from
the internal clock timer on the radio,
and the output from the 'record' socket
is at an ideal level for most cassette
decks. Although the clock is backed up
with an internal battery, if the
household current fails the timer
settings will be lost. You can also
connect two different types of MF/HF
antennae to the NRD 525, and switch
between the two at will.

THE HEAT IS ON !

The back of the receiver most be well
ventilated because after half an hours
use, the panel has reached a
temperature of above 50 degrees
Centigrade. The temptation to put a
book on top of the set is easy to
resist though, as you'll muffle the
built-in speaker. Because that points
towards the ceiling, not towards you,
and sometimes causes the receiver
cabinet to resonate, you're probably
better off using an external speaker or
a pair of headphones. The small
internal speaker doesn't do justice to
the audio quality the receiver is
capable of, which is much less
distorted than the ICOM ICR 71, which
is only slightly cheaper.

The insides of the NRD 525 are well
designed for easy maintenance, and for
simple installation of optional extras,
such as a radio teletype (RTTY)
interface which allows you to print out
the text from radio teletype stations
heard in shortwave. The set has a
Centronics printer connector on the
back.

The set comes with an English language
instruction booklet, which is variable.
Parts are well explained, but some
sections don't use a logical
explanation sequence. The German
language instruction booklet seen in
West Germany turns out to be easier to
follow.

PRICE

The basic price is 3950 Guilders in The
Netherlands, thats 1700 dollars or 1000
pounds sterling. A lot of money for a
receiver. But it turns out to be a lot
of radio. This new set is a welcome
addition to the 'semi-professional' end
of the market, and will provide strong
competition to the ICOM ICR-71 and
existing stocks of the NRD 515.
