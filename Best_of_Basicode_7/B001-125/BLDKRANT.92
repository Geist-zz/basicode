KENWOOD R-5000 ONTVANGER

Wij zijn altijd gek op het testen van nieuwe
apparatuur, vooral als het gaat communicatie
ontvangers. Nog onlangs testten we de Icom R
71, de NRD 525 en de Loewe. Graag brengen we
u de resultaten van de R-5000 van Kenwood in
Hobbyscoop. Een voorlopig model werd al eerder
onder handen genomen door Jonathan Marks van
de Wereldomroep. De testresultaten zijn echter
onder voorbehoud omdat het hier om een
pre-produktie model ging. Jonathan schreef:

The Japanese company of Kenwood have
built up a good reputation in shortwave
listening circles with their R-2000,
R-1000 and R-600 models. All have been
very user friendly, and priced to
attract the average hobbyist at least
in most parts of the world. Formerly
known as Trio-Kenwood, the Trio part of
the label has been discontinued except
in Britain where the brand name
'Kenwood' is owned by a large consumer
electrical manufacturer. The R-5000 is
the latest in the range, top of the
range infact, and its to be released in
about six weeks time. We obtained a
pre-production sample, and did some
rather extensive tests.

The R-5000 turns out to be a light-grey
table-top communications receiver
measuring 279 by 107 by 307 mm, and
weighing in at 5.6 kg. An option exists
to run the set off a 12V car battery,
but it's really designed for use in one
location. Many versions will work off
both 110 and 240 volts AC, though it
will depend on which country you buy
the set. You can't run the set off
batteries, though infact the R-5000
does use its own internal re-chargeable
battery to keep the two independent 24
hour clocks running. The memory
contents are also retained when the set
is not connected to household current.
Official coverage of the receiver is
given as between 100 kHz up to 30 MHz
continuously, though some countries
like West Germany require certain
restrictions on models sold there. A
VHF module can also be installed which
allows additional tuning between 108
and 174 MHz, but this costs extra. The
test R-5000 infact tuned down to 30
kHz, but below 70 kHz nothing could be
heard except synthesizer noise. Here in
Hilversum though, on 77.5 kHz the time
signal station in Mainflingen, Federal
Republic of Germany could be heard with
good strength at the test site some 500
kilometres away.

TUNING

The receiver has two tuning modes,
either via a manual tuning knob, or
using a numeric keypad. Turning the
manual knob in a clockwise direction
causes the set to move up in frequency,
the step being set automatically
depending on the mode that has been
selected. Normally this is 1000 Hz
steps in AM, and 10 Hz steps when using
single-sideband. You can change the
sets in both modes to 100 Hz at the
press of a button. This means you can
fine tune radio-teletype signals easily
and also scan the bands easily without
the sort of chuffing effect in the
speaker while you spin the dial.
Keyboard frequency entry takes a bit of
getting used to. The mode and antenna
buttons double as the keypad, arranged
in two rows of five keys and this
layout is different to a standard
calculator. The microprocessor software
isn't as clever as a cheap portable at
1/3 of the price. Whilst a frequency
such as 13670 kHz can be entered
immediately, 6165 kHz has to entered as
'06165', and 747 kHz as '00747'. The
receiver's stability is excellent,
allowing the use of the Exalted Carrier
Selectable Sideband receiving
technique. The receiver is intelligent
in that no retuning is needed when
switching between any combination of
AM, LSB, and USB. This is in contrast
to the ICOM ICR-71 which jumps 3 kHz
when swapping between USB and LSB.

TWO VFOS

Operating convienience is enhanced by
the use of two variable frequency
oscillators. You can set one to a high
frequency (say 17 MHz), and the other
to a lower channel (e.g. 6 MHz). If
you're using VFO A around 6 MHz and
want to check conditions on higher
frequencies, pushing selecting the
other VFO will allow you to jump to 17
MHz immediately. A 100 channel memory
is also offered, storing the mode, and
antenna number with each stored
frequency. Selectivity positions are
selected automatically, though the sets
seems to always select the WIDE
bandwidth mode for AM stations.
Scanning of the entire contents of the
memory is possible, but also selected
regions too.

In general, so-called 'S' meters on
hobby communications receivers provide
only an approximate indication of
signal strength. The R-5000 meter also
falls into this category. On higher
signal levels the readings are OK, but
on weaker signals the set seems to
underestimate the signal strength. An
RF gain control plus an RF attenuator (
10, 20, and 30 dB selectable steps) are
offered for very strong nearby signals.

VOICE READOUT OPTION

If you have a visual disability then
two features on the set are handy. If
the VOICE button is pushed, a
synthesized female voice announces the
figures displayed on the blue
flourescent digital frequency readout.
It's clear, but the output only comes
through as a constant level in the
headphones or the internal speaker. It
is not available at the RECORD output
for a tape recorder In addition,
pushing the MODE buttons causes a
single letter morse code message to be
heard in the speaker. (i.e. A for AM, L
for LSB etc). Clever thinking. These
days a receivers sensitivity has become
less important than good dynamic range.
Nevertheless, checking to see how even
the set turns out to have sensitivity
which is perfectly adequate over the
most of the range it covers. The
performance on medium wave though is
not good enough for DXing, being
equivalent to an ordinary transistor
portable. Trio appear to have made the
set insensitive in this region to avoid
overloading by local powerful
transmitters.

SELECTIVITY

The R-5000 can be set to select the
appropriate bandwidth filter
automatically, or a manual overide is
possible. The set comes with two
filters NARROW and WIDE as standard for
use on all modes except FM. The FM
filter is 12 kHz wide at -6 dB. Because
the medium and shortwave bands are very
over-crowded, especially in Europe, the
ability to separate the station you
want from the rest is very important.
The AM WIDE filter is within
manufacturers specifications, i.e. 6
kHz at -6 dB. This is fine for general
listening under minimum interference
for conditions.
But with when you're trying to pick out
weaker signals, there is a narrower
filter. This turns out to be 2.9 kHz
wide at -6dB), slightly better than the
manufacturer's specifications. The
dynamic selectivity is such that
nearby signal will have to be 15 times
stronger before it causes severe
reception problem. This is
significantly better than the narrow
filter in the Yaesu FRG-8800, not so
good as the narrow filter on the ICOM
ICR-71.

FAIR DYNAMIC RANGE

When two strong signals appear at the
antenna input, mixing products occur in
many receivers, appearing as 'ghost'
signals on other parts of the dial.
These can be annoying, especially if a
mixing product blocks out a weak signal
you're trying to listen to. How strong
these signals have to be before they
cause problems is an important
specification. Using standard technques
with a 20 kHz signal spacing andthe
narrow 2.9 kHz filter the R-5000 turns
out to have a dynamic range of around
80 dB. That's only only average. This
is not as good as current competing
receivers in the same price range. The
ICOM ICR-71 comes out at 97 dB using
the same compensated mettod, the Yaesu
FRG-8800 at 90 dB. The blocking figures
were also only average.

THREE BIRDIES - A QUIET RECEIVER

Modern frequency synthesizers inside
communications receivers are not
perfect. Birdies are interference
products which appear on the dial as
silent carriers on AM, and whistles in
the single-sideband mode- hence the
name. Weak signals on the same
frequency as a birdie are subject to
interference. Most birdies on the
R-5000 are so weak that they disappear
below the noise level when an antenna
is connected. Three birdies on the
R-5000 are however above 1 microvolt,
and potentially annoying. They are
heard on 18000, 23925 and 29906 kHz,
but fortunately fall outside the
broadcast and amateur radio bands. This
makes the R-5000 a very quiet receiver
compared to its competitors in the same
price class.

The receiver's offers an automatic gain
control can be switched between FAST
and SLOW but not switched off entirely.
An adjustable audio notch filter is
also included in the set. Two
independent noise blankers are included
on the receiver. One is designed to
eliminate the 10 Hz pulse caused by the
Soviet Over-the-Horizon Radar system,
popularly known as the 'Woodpecker'. It
is moderately effective in doing this.
Other forms of pulse type noises can at
least be reduced with the other
blanker. A built in timer can be used
to control a tape-recorder for taping
programmes when the operator is absent.
The internal relay can only switch low
voltages though, not the AC household
current supply. The RECORD level output
is perfect for most tape-recorders. An
optional accessory exists, the IF-232C
Interface, which fits between an RS232C
interface on a home computer, and plugs
into the back of the receiver. No
details have yet been released by
Kenwood as to whether software will be
available for popular personal
computers. Traditionally, receiver
manufacturers have not been very
helpful when it comes to supporting
their idea of connecting a computer to
their receiver. It's a case of 'if you
want it, then write the software
yourself'.

CONCLUSIONS

Examining the specifications the new
R-5000 appears to fall between the
Yaesu FRG-8800 and ICOM ICR-71. It has
better selectivity than the FRG-8800,
but inferior dynamic range. On balance
it is better for shortwave 'DXing'
purposes, buts its considerably more
expensive Whilst the R-5000 has
considerably better audio than the ICOM
ICR-71, its RF blocking and dynamic
range are not as good. The versatile
tuning system will certainly appeal to
the programme listener and DXer alike.
The receiver comes with a very clear
operations manual and a concise
explanation of how signals get from
transmitter to receiver.

Nogmaals, dit is geen definitief oordeel.
Wij willen graag een R-5000 van de Nederlandse
importeur testen, maar zo heeft u vast een
indruk van wat het apparaat zal kunnen. De
mogelijkheid bestaat dat er nog wat
wijzigingen zijn doorgevoerd sindsdien.
